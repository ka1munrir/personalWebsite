        <p className={`${styles.text}`}>Juan Ortiz-Acosta is a computer science student at the University of New Mexico with extensive full stack software engineering training from Flatiron School. While he initially decided to study electrical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, his interest in circuits turned into a passion for programming. He gained experience in Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL, JSON, HTML, CSS, and many web frameworks in Flatiron School where he built many web applications and a mobile application, and he learned Java during his time at Case Western Reserve University. He loves problem solving, collaborating, and learning new things of which he is currently learning Japanese, C, C++, drawing, philosophy, and piano. Juan&#39;s current interests lie in technologies ranging from web, mobile, and computer app development to machine learning and artificial intelligence. He is currently working on a Python desktop application to expand his knowledge of Python and delve into his interest of computer app development.</p>
        <p className={`${styles.text}`}>Before starting the class, I had plenty of experience writing essays and reports. However, this style of writing wasn&#39;t going to be of much use in the industry I wanted to take part in after college. Because of this, english was never a subject that I particularly enjoyed. I always thought &#34;If it&#39;s not useful, why learn it?&#34;. On the other hand, the material I learned this semester is applicable, not only to my field, but any field you might want to go into. As such, I will be applying what I learned this semester throughout the rest of my life because at many points in my life I will probably need to write a resume, cover letter, memo, recommendations report, complaint letter, response letter, or any other of the many documents we learned to make.</p>
