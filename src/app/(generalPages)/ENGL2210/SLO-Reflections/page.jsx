In project 3, we were tasked to find a problem we wanted to solve and either come up with a possible solution to the problem or analyze current solutions. After identifying the problem we wanted to address, we began researching the topic with relation to the problem and then, using the information gathered from the research, we made a presentation recommending or analyzing the feasability of possible solutions.</p>

Understanding how technical documents occupy and respond to social justice and community service contexts.</h3>
            <p className={`${styles.slo_reflections}`}>While this learning outcome relates to all of the projects, it can most clearly be seen in project 1. In project 1, we created a variety of things such as resumes, bios, cover letters, and Linkedin profiles. With this variety of documents, we learned a lot about tailoring our technical documents to a variety of audiences. For example, with resumes, if you were applying to a job in academia, you would want to highlight your education and maybe your research while if you&#39;re applying to industry, it would be better to highlight your experience and skills.</p>

            <p className={`${styles.slo_reflections}`}>Project 2 helped the most in understanding how genre conventions and contextual information impact writing. In project 2, we wrote from both the perspective of a company as well as a customer. Through this, recognizing the nuances of different genres and addressing different audiences I learned how to more effectively engage my indented audience and achieve my goals for the letters.</p>

            <p className={`${styles.slo_reflections}`}>Project 3 displays this learning outcome the most as an entire section to prepare for the final product was dedicated to research. By formulating a clear research question I was able to direct my research in a useful and productive direction. While many of my sources were primary sources due to my need for specific information, I used some secondary soures which compiled many primary sources so that I could get a wide range of statistics for many related areas.</p>

            <p className={`${styles.slo_reflections}`}>In my third project, I employed visual aids to help make my point easier to understand and to display the information in multiple forms rather than just with text. One aspect of visual elements is just the appearance of the visual aid as a whole. Given that the visual aid was for a recommendations report, it was important for it to look professional. As such, the visual aid sticks to a specific color scheme that is not too distracting while still making it visually appealing so that it captivates and maintains the audience&#39;s attention. The visual aid also makes use of diagrams which makes some of the information easier to understand by showing the connections between its different parts.</p>
